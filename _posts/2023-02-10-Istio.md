I hope this series of blog posts will help people in their service mesh journey.

- [What is a Service Mesh ?]({% post_url 2023-02-05-Service-Mesh %})
- __Istio__

In this guide, we will install and test [Istio](https://istio.io/latest/docs/).  
> Istio is an open source service mesh that layers transparently onto existing distributed applications.  
Istio’s powerful features provide a uniform and more efficient way to secure, connect, and monitor services.

## Perquisites

- A Kubernetes cluster running the version 1.22, 1.23, 1.24 or 1.25.
- Loadbalancer service (cloud lb, metallb)

## Installation

All the guide was run on MacOS and used a Kubernetes cluster 1.24 provisioned with kubeadm.

Download `istioctl`.

```sh
> curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -
> cd istio-X-YY-Z
> export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

Run the precheck to ensure `Istio` can be installed (or upgraded) on your environment.

```sh
> istioctl experimental precheck

No issues found when checking the cluster. Istio is safe to install or upgrade!  
To get started, check out https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/
```

Now it is time to install Istio.  
We are using the `demo profile` that contains defaults values for testing purpose.  
There is another profile production.

```sh
> istioctl install --set profile=demo -y

✔ Istio core installed
✔ Istiod installed
✔ Ingress gateways installed
✔ Egress gateways installed
✔ Installation complete

Making this installation the default for injection and validation.
```

Istio is now installed in the `istio-system` namespace.

```sh
> kubectl get po -n istio-system

NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
istio-egressgateway-688d4797cd-4gjwr   1/1     Running   0          3m32s
istio-ingressgateway-6bd9cfd8-xz8b9    1/1     Running   0          3m32s
istiod-68fdb87f7-nnpp2                 1/1     Running   0          3m42s
```

We can retrieve the external IP address of Istio by looking at the services.  
I replace mine with `X.X.X.X`

```sh
> kubectl get svc -n istio-system
NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                                                      AGE
istio-egressgateway    ClusterIP      10.109.214.225   <none>        80/TCP,443/TCP                                                               4m31s
istio-ingressgateway   LoadBalancer   10.98.55.56      X.X.X.X    15021:30712/TCP,80:32215/TCP,443:31094/TCP,31400:31664/TCP,15443:32433/TCP   4m31s
istiod                 ClusterIP      10.111.57.100    <none>        15010/TCP,15012/TCP,443/TCP,15014/TCP                                        4m41s
```

## Configuration

We will now create a namespace named `demo` and label it to instruct Istio to automatically inject Envoy sidecar proxies to any application we will deploy in that namespace.

```sh
> kubectl create ns demo
> kubectl label namespace demo istio-injection=enabled
```

We can verify it by running:

```sh
> kubectl get ns demo --show-labels
```

## Deploy demo application

It's time to deploy the sample app `bookinfo` provide by Istio.
Ensure we are in the istio directory and apply the manifest.

```sh
> kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml -n demo

service/details created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-details created
deployment.apps/details-v1 created
service/ratings created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-ratings created
deployment.apps/ratings-v1 created
service/reviews created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-reviews created
deployment.apps/reviews-v1 created
deployment.apps/reviews-v2 created
deployment.apps/reviews-v3 created
service/productpage created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-productpage created
deployment.apps/productpage-v1 created
```

We can check all the pods are up and running.

```sh
n
```

To verify that everything works properly, let's deploy a pod containing curl binary and ensure that we can connect to the application.  
By looking at the service, we can see the app is listening on `port 9080`.  
First apply the pod manifest.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: curl
  labels:
    app: curl
spec:
  containers:
  - command:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - --
    args:
    - while true; do sleep 30; done;
    image: curlimages/curl
    name: curl
```

Then try to curl the product page `productpage:9080`

```sh
> kubectl exec curl -- curl -Ss productpage:9080

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Simple Bookstore App</title>
<meta charset="utf-8"
...
...
...
```

## Expose the app to outside

To be able to access our application from the outside, we need to create an t
Istio Ingress Gateway manage inbound and outbound traffic for your mesh.  
We configure the host and port available for requests.  
Let's apply the `Gateway` and `VirtualService` provide in the sample.
It looks like:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: bookinfo-gateway
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway # use istio default controller
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - "*"
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: bookinfo
spec:
  hosts:
  - "*"
  gateways:
  - bookinfo-gateway
  http:
  - match:
    - uri:
        exact: /productpage
    - uri:
        prefix: /static
    - uri:
        exact: /login
    - uri:
        exact: /logout
    - uri:
        prefix: /api/v1/products
    route:
    - destination:
        host: productpage
        port:
          number: 9080
```

```sh
> kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml -n demo

gateway.networking.istio.io/bookinfo-gateway created
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/bookinfo created
```

We can validate the configuration with istioctl

```sh
> istioctl analyze -n demo

✔ No validation issues found when analyzing namespace: demo.
```

We need to retrieve the External IP of the `istio-ingressgateway`:

```sh
> kubectl get svc -n istio-system
```

With the IP, we can now ensure the external access, just by running curl command:

```sh
> curl http://[External-IP]:80/productpage

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Simple Bookstore App</title>
...
...
...
```

## Observability

One of the key features of `service mesh` is observability.  
Istio provide basic installation for the following observability tools:

- [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io)
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io)
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com)
- [Kiali](https://kiali.io)

let's install them.

```sh
> kubectl apply -f samples/addons
```

We will not go into details of each tool but more have an overview of what can be achieve for observability.

### Jaeger

`Jaeger` is a `distributed tracing` tool that allows to trace application regardless of the language or framework used.  
Before being able to see anything we need to generate some trace by accessing our application one or more time.

```sh
> curl http://[External-IP]:80/productpage
```

Now, we can launch the `jaeger dashboard` to see the traces generated.

```sh
> istioctl dashboard jaeger
http://localhost:16686
```

### Grafana

`Grafana` is an open source monitoring solution with an amazing community that provide all sort of ready to use dashboards.  
Of course it's possible to build are own as well.

```sh
> istioctl dashboard grafana
http://localhost:3000
```

On Grafana, we need to go to the `dashboard` menu and then inside the `istio` folder.
Let's open the `Istio Service Dashboard` and select the productpage's service.

### Kiali

`Kiali` is an open source solution to observe microservices traffic flows inside a service mesh.  
Let's generate some traffic again and start the Kiali dashboard.
```sh
> curl http://[External-IP]:80/productpage
> istioctl dashboard kiali
http://localhost:20001/kiali
```

We need to go to the `Graph` menu and select our demo namespace in the dropdown list.  
We can see the relationships between the service of the app and visualize the its traffic flow.

## Cleaning up

```sh
> kubectl delete -f samples/addons
> istioctl uninstall --purge
> kubectl delete ns istio-system
> kubectl delete -f samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml -n demo
```

## Conclusion

Thanks to all resources provided by Istio, we are able to setup very quickly a demo of service mesh and experienced with it.

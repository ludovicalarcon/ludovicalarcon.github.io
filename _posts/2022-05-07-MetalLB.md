title: Add LoadBalancer Service with MetalLB on bare metal clusters

If you ever installed Kubernetes clusters on-premise, you probably noticed that you cannot use `LoadBalancer service`.  
You could remplace it with `NodePort service` and manage your own LoadBalancer to distribute traffic. That's is additional works and complexity you may not want handle.  
Furthermore this leads to specificity between on-premise and cloud environment.
Luckily, [MetalLB](https://github.com/metallb/metallb) comes to our rescue!

## __MetalLB__

According to their [documentation](https://metallb.universe.tf)

> MetalLB is a load-balancer implementation for bare metal Kubernetes clusters, using standard routing protocols.

MetalLB supports both `BGP` and `Layer2` configuration. In this blog post, we will setup a Layer2 configuration with IPv4.

## __Prerequisites__

You need:
- A working Kubernetes cluster in version 1.13 or above. If you don't have one, you can setup a [local cluster with Kubeadm]({% post_url 2022-04-23-Kubeadm-containerd %})
- A range of IPs on the same subnet than your nodes.
- A [Network Addon](https://metallb.universe.tf/installation/network-addons/) that can coexist with MetalLB

## __Installation__

First of all, we need to add the helm repository and make sure all our repositories are up to date.
```sh
helm repo add metallb https://metallb.github.io/metallb
helm repo update
```

We will then create the `values.yaml` to configure MetalLB to use Layer2 with our IPs adress range.  
I used `10.0.0.0/24` as subnet for my nodes and I will configure IPs from `10.0.0.240` to `10.0.0.250` for MetalLB.
```yaml
# values.yaml
configInline:
  address-pools:
   - name: default
     protocol: layer2
     addresses:
     - 10.0.0.240-10.0.0.250
```
Finally, we will create a dedicated namespace `metallb-system` and install the helm chart in it
```sh
> kubectl create ns metallb-system

> helm install metallb metallb/metallb -f values.yaml -n metallb-system
```

We can verify the configuration (output is cut for clarity)
```sh
> kubectl get cm metallb -n metallb-system -oyaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  config: |
    address-pools:
    - addresses:
      - 10.0.0.240-10.0.0.250
      name: default
      protocol: layer2
kind: ConfigMap
```
When we create a LoadBalancer service, the next available address will be pick by MetalLB in the `address pool range` we defined.


You can find advanced configuration and BGP on [documentation](https://metallb.universe.tf/configuration/)


## __LoadBalancer Service in Action__

Let's deploy an nginx pod and expose it as a LoadBalancer service.
```sh
> kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
> kubectl expose pod nginx --type=LoadBalancer --port 80
```
Let's verify we got an external IP and it's one in our adress pool.
```sh
> kubectl get svc
NAME    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
nginx   LoadBalancer   10.104.223.189   10.0.0.240    80:30850/TCP   5s
```
Great, last step, we will curl our endpoint and see if everything is working properly
```
> curl 10.0.0.240

Success! With `MetalLB` we could add LoadBalancer service support on non-cloud Kubernetes clusters.

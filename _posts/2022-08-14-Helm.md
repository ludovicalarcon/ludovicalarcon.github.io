## __What is Helm ?__

From [Helm repository](https://github.com/helm/helm)

> Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

Helm allows to deploy and manage Kubernetes application as a `unit of deployment` which means you can manage your deployment like it is "one object".  
This unit of deployment is call a `Chart` and bundles one or more Kubernetes YAML manifests that define all the resources required by the application.  
Helm also manage the `upgrade` and the `rollbacks` of your application.  
You can think of it as a package manager for Kubernetes, like apt or homebrew.

To [install helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

## __Helm chart__

When you deploy an application on Kubernetes, you generally need to create different resources.  
Let's consider a simple todo API, the minimum you need is:
- A __deployment__ to manage your pods
- A __service__ to ensure load-balancing between our pod
- An __ingress__ to expose HTTP(S) endpoint from outside the cluster to the service

All those resources are defined in separate YAML manifests, and we need to manage them all to ensure our todo API run properly.  
As we see previously, the `Helm Chart` bundles all the YAML files and treat then as a `unit of deployment`.  
Instead of having to think about deploying all manifests we need, we can use simply one command.
```sh
> helm install ReleaseName MyChart
```

Helm really shine because it's not just about deploy application but `manage` it.  
When you install a Chart, it is versioned (everything is stored in Kubernetes secrets).  
That allows us to quickly `rollback` to a previous version or `upgrade` our deployment.

It possible to list all helm charts installed on the cluster and see the chart version and the current revision as well.
```sh
> helm list -A
```
The `-A` option allows to see on all namespaces and the `-n` allows to specify a namespace (like kubectl binary).

## __Helm chart structure__

Let's create a Chart for our simple todo API.  
To boostrap a new Chart, we simple need to run the `helm create` command.
```sh
> helm create todo
```
It will create a directory filled with everything needed.  
The create command generate a sample chart that deploy nginx to get started easily.  
```
todo
├── .helmignore
├── Chart.yaml
├── charts
├── templates
│   ├── NOTES.txt
│   ├── _helpers.tpl
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── hpa.yaml
│   ├── ingress.yaml
│   ├── service.yaml
│   ├── serviceaccount.yaml
│   └── tests
│       └── test-connection.yaml
└── values.yaml
```
- `Chart.yaml` includes Charts informations such as its name, description and version.  
You can find a description of all fields available [here](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-chartyaml-file)
- `Values.yaml` contains all default values for the Chart, this values are also use for documentation.  
We will see later on, how values are very useful.
- `templates` directory contains all YAML manifests needed to deploy the application
- `_helpers.tpl` is the default file to store helpers that can be accessed by name elsewhere.
- `tests` directory is optional and contains the tests files.  
- `charts` directory will contains all dependences. As there is no dependency in this example, it is empty.
- `.helmignore` allows to exclude files/directory when the chart is `packaged`.  
Which means the excluded resources will not be included in the chart.

Let's do some cleaning by deleting the `charts` folder, the content of the `templates` directory and the content of the `values.yaml`.

## __Helm Template__

Let's consider we have the following deployment manifest and two others for the service and ingress.
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: todo-deployment
  labels:
    app: todo
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: todo
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 0
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: todo
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: example/todo:1.0
        name: todo
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```
As we previously see, to be able to install our application with helm we just need to copy our manifest in the `templates` directory and then use the `helm install command`.

But now, let's imagine we want to deploy another version of our todo, we will have to duplicate our chart and change at least the name and the image's tag.  
The main problem with that is we have to maintain two charts which do the same things with only some different values.  
This could lead to issue or oversight in the charts maintenance.  

Helm tackles this by providing a `templating` system and replacing all mustache sections with provided values present in the `values.yaml` file.  
The templating is really more powerfull than just replace the values when `rendering`, it also allows to add logic in charts, such as control flow, loop, etc..

This is how our above deployment could look like with templating.
```yaml
# templates/deployment.yaml
{% raw %}
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-deployment
  labels:
    app: {{ .Release.Name }}
spec:
  replicas: {{ .Values.replicas }}
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: {{ .Release.Name }}
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 0
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: {{ .Release.Name }}
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: {{ .Values.image.name }}:{{ .Values.image.tag }}
        name: {{ .Release.Name }}
        ports:
        - containerPort: {{ .Values.containerPort }}
{% endraw %}
```
```yaml
# values.yaml
# releaseName: todo
replicas: 3
containerPort: 8080
image:
  name: "example/todo"
  tag: 1.0
```
Let's review the template:
- `Templates` are YAML manifest with mustache syntax {% raw %}`{{ }}`{% endraw %} defining dynamic sections that should be replaced.
- Helm provides [various variables](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/builtin_objects/) that will be populated at install time (ex {% raw %}`{{ .Release.Name }}`{% endraw %}).
- You can provide values at install time, if no values are provided, helm will use the default one defined in `values.yaml` file.  

You can provide values either with a value file using `-f` option.
```sh
> helm install ReleaseName MyChart -f values-override.yaml
```
or with the `--set` option
```sh
> helm install ReleaseName MyChart --set MyValue=2
# example with tag
> helm install todo todoChart --set image.tag=1.1
```

## __Advance Helm Template__

Now, let's see how could look like our ingress template.
```yaml
# templates/ingress.yaml
{% raw %}
{{- if .Values.ingress.enabled }} # Condition on enabled value
{{- $name := .Release.Name }} # variable declaration
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    {{- toYaml .Values.ingress.annotations | nindent 4 }} # Using helpers
  name: "{{ $name }}-ingress" # Using a variable
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
    {{- range .Values.ingress.hosts }} # loop on hosts array in values
    - host: {{ .host | quote }} # current host, context change in loop to be set on the current object of iteration
      http:
        paths:
        {{- range .paths }} # loop on paths array in hosts section
          - backend:
              service:
                name: "{{ $name }}-svc"
                port:
                  number: {{ $.Values.service.port }} # $ allows to use root context
            path: {{ .path }} # Context is on current path object
            pathType: Prefix
        {{- end }}
    {{- end }}
{{- end }}
{% endraw %}
```
{% raw %}
The ingress demonstrates a number of features of Helm templates:
- `Condition`: the condition is defined with `{{- if CONDITION }}` and scoped all inside until the `{{- end }}`
- `Variable`: We can define variable inside template with `{{- $varName := varValue }}`
- `Loop`: the loop syntax is the same as condition except the keyword `range` is used
- Loops change the `current context` so the `.` references the current object of the iteration
- `$` refers to the root context
{% endraw %}
The values.yaml file:
```yaml
# values.yaml
# releaseName: todo
replicas: 3
containerPort: 8080
image:
  name: "example/todo"
  tag: 1.0

service:
  port: 80

ingress:
  enabled: true
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
  hosts:
    - host: "example.com"
      paths:
        - path: /
    - host: "example2.com"
      paths:
        - path: /
```

## __Package / Install / Upgrade / Uninstall__

#### __Package__

When helm chart is ready we can [package](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_package/) and install it.  
`Package` a chart is basically bundle everything into a `tgz` named by combining its name and version.
```sh
# inside the chart folder
> helm package .
Successfully packaged chart and saved it to: /YOUR/PATH/todo-0.1.0.tgz
```

#### __Install__

A chart can be `stored locally` or hosted in `remote chart repository`.  
So their is mainly 3 ways to [install a chart](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/)
- From source
```sh
> helm install ReleaseName .
```
- From tgz
```sh
> helm install ReleaseName chart.tgz
```
- From remote repository
```sh
# add the repository
> helm repo add NAME URL
> helm install ReleaseName Chart
```
As we saw previously, you can override the values with `-f` options.

#### __Upgrade__

To upgrade the installed chart, we need to proceed like the installation but using the `helm upgrade` command instead.  
The revision of the release will be incremented by 1.
```sh
> helm upgrade ReleaseName chart.tgz
```
When upgrading, we can either provide new values with `-f` option or reuse the one used previously with `--reuse-values` option.
```sh
> helm upgrade ReleaseName chart.tgz --reuse-values
```

To have information on a release, we can use the `helm show` command with one of its subcommands.
```
> helm show -h
This command consists of multiple subcommands to display information about a chart

Usage:
  helm show [command]

Aliases:
  show, inspect

Available Commands:
  all         show all information of the chart
  chart       show the chart's definition
  crds        show the chart's CRDs
  readme      show the chart's README
  values      show the chart's values
```

We can have information on [the differents revisions](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_history/) with the `helm history` command.
```sh
> helm history ReleaseName
```
Finally, to [rollback](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_rollback/) to a previous revision, we will use the `helm rollback` command.
```sh
> helm rollback ReleaseName Revision
```

#### __Uninstall__

To [remove all resources](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) associated with the installed chart, we need the `helm uninstall` command.
```sh
> helm uninstall ReleaseName
```

## __Debug Chart__

To validate and/or debug a chart we can combined the `--dry-run` and `--debug` options on the `helm install` command.
```sh
> helm install ReleaseName chart.tgz --dry-run --debug
```
The chart will not be installed, but it will be rendered and validated.  
In case of error, a stack trace will be provided to help identify and fix the issue.

It's also possible to just render a chart or a file with the `helm render` command.
```sh
# inside the chart folder
> helm template .

# A specific file
> helm template . -s templates/someFile.yaml
```

## __To infinity and beyond ...__

To have deeper understanding, you can recreate the default chart and analyse all files.
